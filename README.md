# Basic Introduction to C Programming

## Objective
- To be familiar with the basic syntax of C programming.
- To learn problem-solving techniques using C.

## History of C
The C programming language was developed in 1972 by **Dennis Ritchie** at Bell Laboratories as part of the UNIX operating system project. It evolved from earlier languages like B and BCPL, incorporating features that made it efficient for system-level programming. Initially designed to reimplement UNIX, C gained popularity for its simplicity, portability, and flexibility. It has since influenced modern languages like C++, Java, and Python.

## Key Concepts

### Header Files
- Header files contain declarations for functions, macros, and constants.
- Example: `#include <stdio.h>` gives access to functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`.

### Main Function
- Every C program starts with the `main()` function.
- Example forms:
  ```c
  int main() {
      return 0;
  }
  ```

### Variables
- Used to store data in memory.
- Must be declared with a type before use, e.g., `int num = 5;`.

### Constants
- Fixed values that do not change during program execution.
- Defined using `const` or `#define`.

### Keywords
- Reserved words in C with specific meanings (e.g., `int`, `return`, `if`, `else`).

### Comments
- Single-line: `//`
- Multi-line: `/* ... */`
